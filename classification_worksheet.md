## üß™ **Novelty and Annotations**

7. **From the `novel_not_in_catalog` isoforms, how many have all of their junctions canonical?**
    *(Use the `all_canonical` column.)*  
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>There are 851 isoforms with all the junctions canonical and 288 with at least one non-canonical junction</details><br>

8. **From the isoforms classified as fusion, which one has the highest number of genes and what genes are they?**  
   <details><summary>Answer</summary> All 38 fusion transcripts are formed by 2 genes. Example gene pairs: ENSG00000100181.22_ENSG00000283633.1, ENSG00000100029.18_ENSG00000128242.13, and 15 more</details><br>

9. **Filter transcripts where `associated_transcript` is `novel`. What percentage of the total do they represent?**  
   <details><summary>Answer</summary>57.27%</details><br>

## üß™ **Coding and ORFs**

10. **How many transcripts are predicted to be coding (`coding` column)?**  
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>3180</details><br>

11. **Among coding transcripts, what is the average ORF length (`ORF_length` column)?**  
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>389.17 bp</details><br>

12. **Which transcript has the longest predicted ORF, and what is its structural category?**  
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>PB.3857.1, ORF length: 2414, Category: full-splice_match</details><br>

13. **How many transcripts are predicted to be subject to nonsense-mediated decay? What does it mean?**  
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>475.
    Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a cellular mechanism that degrades mRNA transcripts containing premature stop codons, preventing the production of truncated proteins that could be harmful to the cell. SQANTI3 is able to flag transcripts like this if during the ORF prediction, a STOP codon is found before the TTS
    <!-- TODO: Complete this with additional details on NMD and its implications for transcript analysis. -->

## üß† **Advanced / Comparative**

Now, lets compare the classification file that used all of the orthogonal data, to see what extra information SQANTI3 is able to integrate.

14. **How many columns have been filled with information in the new classification? Name some of them.**  
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>
    There are 13 new columns that have been filled with information now, such as:
    
    - min_cov --> Minimum coverage of a splice junction
    - within_CAGE_peak
    - polyA_motif_found
    </details><br>

15. **From the FSM isoforms, how many have both support from a CAGE peak and a polyA motif? And the ISM?**  
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>
    - FSM: 336 isoforms
    - ISM: 107 isoforms
    </details><br>

16. **What is the average minimum coverage of a junction for each structural category?**
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>

    | Structural Category        | coverage mean | coverage sd |
    |---------------------------|----------|--------|
    | antisense                 | 0.000    | 0.000  |
    | full-splice_match         | 9.880    | 42.700 |
    | fusion                    | 0.289    | 0.867  |
    | genic                     | 0.000    | 0.000  |
    | genic_intron              | 0.000    | 0.000  |
    | incomplete-splice_match   | 20.100   | 53.500 |
    | intergenic                | 0.000    | 0.000  |
    | novel_in_catalog          | 14.600   | 66.200 |
    | novel_not_in_catalog      | 0.512    | 2.750  |

## üìÅ **Integration**

17. **From the ISM isoforms that have support from a CAGE peak and a polyA motif, what are their subcategories? How would you explain this?.**  
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>

    - 3prime_fragment: 33  
    - 5prime_fragment: 34  
    - internal_fragment: 1  
    - intron_retention: 31  
    - mono-exon: 8
</details><br>

18. **There is a hypothesis made in the SQANTI3 paper that states that the TSS ratio is higher on isoforms supported by a CAGE peak. Would you say that assumption is true based on the results you obtained?** Briefly explain why it would make sense or not. 

<!-- TODO: make this figure pretty -->

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
As we can see in the plot, there is a higher TSS ratio for the isoforms supported by a CAGE peak, which is consistent with the hypothesis. This is because CAGE peaks are indicative of real transcription start sites (and not artifacts of degradation), and isoforms with higher TSS ratios are more likely to be associated with such peaks.
