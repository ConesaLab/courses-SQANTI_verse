# SQANTI filter worksheet

This worksheet is designed to guide you through the analysis of SQANTI3 Quality Control outputs, focusing on both the basic and complete classification.txt files. In the first part, you will examine each classification independently to understand how and why isoforms are assigned specific categories. In the second part, you will compare the two classifications to explore the impact of integrating orthogonal data sources‚Äîsuch as short reads, CAGE peaks, and polyA motifs‚Äîon transcript validation and interpretation.

## üîç Rules exploration

1. From the set of rules on the file `data/filter_rules.json`, **are you able to write down the explanation of what they will check?**
    *example: Keep FSM isoforms that are up to 50 nt from the reference TSS OR are 50 nts downstream of a CAGE peak AND have no Retrotranscriptase switching AND there are no more than 60% of As downstream the TSS*
